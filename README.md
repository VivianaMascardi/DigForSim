# DigForSim

DigForSim is an Agent Based Modeling and Simulation(ABMS) tool designed and implemented by Alessandro Biagetti to fulfill his Master Thesis in Computer Science at the University of Genova, under the guidance of Prof. Viviana Mascardi (University of Genova) and Dr. Angelo Ferrando (University of Liverpool). 

The idea of implementing DigForSim was born inside the "Digital Forensics: Evidence Analysis via Intelligent Systems and Practices" (DigForASP) COST Action CA17124, https://digforasp.uca.es, funded for four years starting from 10/09/2018 by the European Cooperation in Science and Technology COST, www.cost.eu. The challenge addressed by DigForASP is to reason  on  evidences  on  crimes  and  their  perpetrators  collected  from  various  electronic devices in order to reconstruct possible events, event sequences and scenarios related to the crime.

DigForSim produces realistic and controllable synthetic data logging people's movement in user-defined environments modeling a city, a borough, or a house. These synthetic data will be used as benchmarks while testing the prototypes developed in DigForASP. Controlling the way in which such benchmarks are produced and being able to enforce situations of interest to emerge ("alice and bob were in the same place for more than 5 minutes, in three different occasions"), is a main requirement to properly assess the reasoning process performed by the DigForASP prototypes ("given that alice and bob were in the same place for more than 5 minutes, in three different occasions, they might know each other, might have exchanged information or stuff, and might be partners in crime"). DigForSim is implemented in Unity and it is described in details in Alessandro Biagetti's Master Thesis, available here: https://github.com/VivianaMascardi/DigForSim/blob/master/BiagettiAlessandroThesis2019-def.pdf
